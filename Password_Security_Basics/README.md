# Password Security Analysis – Beginner Cybersecurity Project



## Project Overview

This project analyses password security by examining common weaknesses

in user-created passwords and how these weaknesses increase the risk

of brute-force and credential-based attacks.


## Technical Concepts Covered

- Password entropy

- Brute-force attacks

- Dictionary attacks

- Credential reuse

- Authentication security



## Tools and Skills Used

- Password strength analysis

- Threat modelling

- Security best practices

- Risk awareness



## Analysis Process

1. Identified examples of weak passwords based on length, predictability,

   and character variety.

2. Analysed how attackers use brute-force and dictionary attacks

   to guess weak passwords.

3. Reviewed the impact of password reuse across multiple services.

4. Evaluated best practices such as password length, complexity,

   and uniqueness.



## Findings

Short and predictable passwords with common patterns are vulnerable

to automated attacks. Reused passwords significantly increase the

risk of account compromise when a single service is breached.



## Security Recommendations

- Use passwords with a minimum length of 12–16 characters.

- Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns.

- Use unique passwords for each service.

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.



## What I Learned

This project strengthened my understanding of how poor password

practices contribute to account compromise and how strong

authentication controls reduce security risk.
