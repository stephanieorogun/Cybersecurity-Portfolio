# Phishing Email Analysis – Beginner Project

## Objective
The goal of this project is to learn how to identify a phishing email
by checking for common warning signs.

## Tools Used
- Email sample (training example)
- Observation skills
- Basic cybersecurity knowledge

## Steps Taken
1. I checked the sender’s email address.
2. I looked for spelling and grammar mistakes.
3. I checked if the email created fear or urgency.
4. I inspected the link without clicking it.

## Findings
I noticed that the email tried to scare the user and asked for
personal information, which is a common phishing technique.

## What I Learned
This project helped me understand how phishing emails trick users
and how to stay safe by carefully checking emails before clicking
any links.
